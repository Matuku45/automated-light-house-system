Automated Light-House System – Full Web Application Plan
Project Description

A web-based home automation simulation system. Users can upload a house plan, interact with it, and control the simulation of LEDs and a buzzer. The system includes a user dashboard, pages for information, and interactive features to view, edit, and simulate house plans.
